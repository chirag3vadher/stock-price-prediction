# Stock Price Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict stock prices using historical data and financial indicators.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Fetch historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Calculate financial indicators such as moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), etc., from the historical data.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize the data.
4. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or LSTM on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models on the validation set using metrics like MSE or MAPE.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the model parameters to improve performance.
7. **Final Evaluation**: Test the final model on the test set to assess its performance.
8. **Deployment**: Deploy the model for predictions on new stock data.

2. Execute the `main.py` script located in the `src/` directory to run the entire pipeline.

## Detailed Explanation

### Data Collection
- We chose the `yfinance` library for fetching historical stock price data due to its ease of use and extensive coverage of stock data.

### Feature Engineering
- We calculated financial indicators such as moving averages, RSI, and MACD to capture important trends and patterns in the stock price data.

### Data Preprocessing
- Data preprocessing involved cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the data to ensure that it is suitable for training machine learning models.

### Model Building
- We experimented with multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM to determine the best approach for stock price prediction.

### Model Evaluation
- Model evaluation was performed using metrics like MSE and MAPE on a validation set to assess the performance of the trained models.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Hyperparameter tuning was conducted to fine-tune the model parameters and improve performance using techniques like Grid Search.

### Final Evaluation
- The final model was evaluated on a test set to provide an unbiased estimate of its performance on unseen data.

### Deployment
- Once the model was trained and evaluated, it was deployed for predictions on new stock data in real-time.
